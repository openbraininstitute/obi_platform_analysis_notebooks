## Summary
This notebook demonstrates how to load electrophysiology data using h5py for eFEL e-features extraction.

## Notes
- Here we show how to use [eFEL](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/eFEL) extract e-features from the whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology data. 
- The data is in nwb format.
- Users can use various [electrical features](https://efel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eFeatures.html)
