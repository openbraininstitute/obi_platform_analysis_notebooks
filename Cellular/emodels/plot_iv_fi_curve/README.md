## Summary
This notebook demonstrates how to compute and visualize IV and FI curves for a single-cell model using BlueCelluLab. It explores key neuronal properties like input resistance and firing threshold while showing how different injection and recording locations affect excitability and signal propagation.

In order to run this notebook, you will have to install the dependencies listed in analysis_info.json in requirements, and you will have to download the cadpyr_emodel.zip file that you can find in the OneDrive under OBI - Scientific Staff / Documents / Data / Analysis notebook data
