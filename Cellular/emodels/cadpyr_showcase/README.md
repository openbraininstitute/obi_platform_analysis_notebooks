## Summary
Notebook to demonstrate various properties of the OBP detailed morphology canonical cADPyr (continuos firing and adapting type pyramidal neuron) e-model such as 
- optimisation protocols
- [currentscape](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/Currentscape) analysis
- frequency-current (F-I) curve
- current-voltage (V-I) curve
- recordings in different sections of the neuron using [BlueCellulab](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/BlueCelluLab)
- dendritic potential decay 
- backpropagating action potential (bAP) recordings
- excitatory postsynaptic potential(EPSP) recordings and EPSP ratio.
